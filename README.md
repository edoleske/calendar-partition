# calendar-partition

This project is for answering/visualizing a niche question:

Suppose you need to pull data from a database by month, where the range falls from the first of the month to the first of the next month. If that database were partitioned in blocks of N days, what would be the most ideal parameter N to partition the tables, provided they are not partitioned by month?
